# SQL-Challenge

## Objective
In this challenge, I analyze employee data from a hypothetical company Pewlett Hackard.  Using PostgreSQL I created a database with 6 tables populated with old csv files.  I then created queries that evaluate different parameters about employees, e.g., salary, employees hired in1986, employees named "Hercules".
